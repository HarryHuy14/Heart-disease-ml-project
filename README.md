# Heart-disease-ml-project
Hello everybody and thanks for coming and viewing my project!\
\
This is my first Machine Learning (ML) project after learning through some basic ML concepts, frameworks as well as libraries to predict that patients whether they have heart disease - or not, based on the given data of their health status, divided into many features. And the goal is to achieve the accuracy as highest as possible!\
\
I wrote comments on almost every blocks of code so that readers can easily follow the framework of this project.
